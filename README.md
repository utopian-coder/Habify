# Habify Tech Website 👋

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Habify. We’re a bunch of people who identify as ‘humans’. Together, we are makers, thinkers, foodies, habit-builders and bathroom singers. We approach work and play with curiosity and experimentation (sometimes with sarcasm and wit), using what we learn to create a meaningful community that connects with people, just like you. We believe that mental health is a birth right. Each day we strive to do our part to make the world a little less lonely. After all, our minds are the only place in which we truly live.

## Tech Used 🛠️

- React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS Modules: A CSS approach that locally scopes styles to avoid global naming conflicts.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the project! 🚀
